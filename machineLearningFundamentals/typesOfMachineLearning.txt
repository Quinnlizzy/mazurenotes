There are multiple types of machine learning; 
you must apply the appropriate type depending on what trying to predict.


Supervised machine learning (SML):
general term for ML algorithms where training data includes BOTH feature values and known label values.
It's used to train models by determining relationship between features & labels in past obs.
Then unknown labels can be predicted for features in future cases.


Regression (SML):
Form of SML where the label predicted is numeric value.
E.g. no. ice creams sold per day, based on the temp/rain etc, fuel efficiency based on car engine/weight etc


Classification (SML):
SML where label represents a categorization/class. Two common classification scenarios.

     1)Binary classification
       The label determines whether the observed item is (or isn't) an instance of a specific class.
       Effectively the model predicts one of two mutually exclusive outcomes. E.g.
        - Whether patient is diabetes risk based on clinical metrics(weight/age etc)
        - Whether bank customer will default on loan based on income/credit history etc.
       In these examples, model predicts a binary true/false or positive/negative prediction for a single possible class.

     2)Multiclass classification
       Extends binary classification to predict label that is one of multiple possible classes. E.g.
        - Species of a penguin (Adelie, Gentoo, or Chinstrap) based on physical measurements.
        - Genre of movie (comedy/horror/romance etc) based on cast/director/budget.
       In most scenarios that involve a known set of multiple classes, multiclass classification is used to predict mutually exclusive labels. For example, a penguin can't be both a Gentoo and an Adelie. However, there are also some algorithms that you can use to train multilabel classification models, in which there may be more than one valid label for a single observation. For example, a movie could potentially be categorized as both science fiction and comedy.
