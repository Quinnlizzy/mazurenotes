There are multiple types of machine learning; 
you must apply the appropriate type depending on what trying to predict.

Supervised machine learning:
general term for ML algorithms where training data includes BOTH feature values and known label values.
It's used to train models by determining relationship between features & labels in past obs.
Then unknown labels can be predicted for features in future cases.
