There are multiple types of machine learning; 
you must apply the appropriate type depending on what trying to predict.


Supervised machine learning (SML):
general term for ML algorithms where training data includes BOTH feature values and known label values.
It's used to train models by determining relationship between features & labels in past obs.
Then unknown labels can be predicted for features in future cases.


Regression (SML):
Form of SML where the label predicted is numeric value.
E.g. no. ice creams sold per day, based on the temp/rain etc, fuel efficiency based on car engine/weight etc


Classification (SML):
SML where label represents a categorization/class. Two common classification scenarios.

     1)Binary classification
       The label determines whether the observed item is (or isn't) an instance of a specific class.
       Effectively the model predicts one of two mutually exclusive outcomes. E.g.
        - Whether patient is diabetes risk based on clinical metrics(weight/age etc)
        - Whether bank customer will default on loan based on income/credit history etc.
       In these examples, model predicts a binary true/false or positive/negative prediction for a single possible class.

     2)Multiclass classification
       Extends binary classification to predict label that is one of multiple possible classes. E.g.
        - Species of a penguin (Adelie, Gentoo, or Chinstrap) based on physical measurements.
        - Genre of movie (comedy/horror/romance etc) based on cast/director/budget.
       In most scenarios with multiple classes, multiclass classification is used to predict mutually exclusive labels. 
       E.g. penguin can't be both Gentoo AND Adelie. 
       However, there are algorithms that you can use to train multilabel classification models where there may be 
       more than one valid label for a single obs (e.g. film could be science fiction AND comedy).
