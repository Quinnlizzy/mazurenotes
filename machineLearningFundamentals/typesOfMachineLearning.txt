There are multiple types of machine learning; 
you must apply the appropriate type depending on what trying to predict.


Supervised machine learning (SML):
general term for ML algorithms where training data includes BOTH feature values and known label values.
It's used to train models by determining relationship between features & labels in past obs.
Then unknown labels can be predicted for features in future cases.


Regression (SML):
Form of SML where the label predicted is numeric value.
E.g. no. ice creams sold per day, based on the temp/rain etc, fuel efficiency based on car engine/weight etc


Classification (SML):
SML where label represents a categorization/class. Two common classification scenarios.
