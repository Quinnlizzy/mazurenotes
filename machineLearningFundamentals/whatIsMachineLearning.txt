What is machine learning?

Fundamental idea = use data from past observations to predict unknown outcomes/values. 

E.g.:

- Ice cream store might use app that combines past sales and weather records to predict sales based on that days forecast
- Doctor use data from past patients to run tests that predict if patient is at risk from diabetes based on various measurements.
- Researcher use past obs to automate the ID of penguin species based on measurements of flippers/bill etc
