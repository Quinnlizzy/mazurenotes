What is machine learning?

Fundamental idea = use data from past observations to predict unknown outcomes/values. 

E.g.:

- Ice cream store might use app that combines past sales and weather records to predict sales based on that days forecast
- Doctor use data from past patients to run tests that predict if patient is at risk from diabetes based on various measurements.
- Researcher use past obs to automate the ID of penguin species based on measurements of flippers/bill etc

Machine learning as a function
 - Because based on maths/stats, common to think of ML models in mathematical terms. 
 - Fundamentally, an ML model is an app that encapsulates a function to calculate an output value based on input value(s).
 - The process of defining the function = training.
 - After function is defined, you can use it to predict new values via inferencing.

Training data consists of:
 - past obs that include attributes/features of the thing being observed.
 - the known value of the thing you want to train a model to predict (the label).

Mathematical terms: 
 - features = variable name x, 
 - label = y. 

Obs will have multiple feature values, so x is actually a vector (an array with multiple values: [x1,x2,x3,...]).


consider prev examples:
 - ice cream sales;   goal = train a model that can predict ice cream sales based on weather.
                      Weather measurements (temp, rain etc) are features (x)
                      Number of ice creams sold each day is label (y).
 - medical scenario;  goal = predict if patient is diabetes risk 
                      Clinical measurements (weight, glucose level) are features (x)
                      Likelihood of diabetes (1 for risk, 0 for not) is label (y).
 - Research scenario; goal = predict the penguin species based on physical attributes. 
                      Penguin measurements (flipper length, bill width) are features (x), 
                      Species (0 for Adelie, 1 for Gentoo etc) is label (y).

An algorithm is applied to the data to determine a relationship between features & label
and generalize that relationship as a calculation that can be performed on 'x' to calculate 'y'.
Algorithm depends on kind of predictive problem trying to solve
Basic principle is try to fit data to a function where values of the features(x) can calculate label(y).

Result of algorithm = model that encapsulates the calculation derived by algorithm as a function - (f). 
In efect: y = f(x)

4)
With training phase complete, the trained model can now inferencing. 
Model is software program that encapsulates the function produced by the training process. 
You input set of feature values and receive as output a prediction of corresponding label.
 Because output = a prediction, NOT an observed value, output is shown as Å· (verbalized "y-hat").
