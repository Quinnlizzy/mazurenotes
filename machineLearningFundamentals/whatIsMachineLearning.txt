What is machine learning?

Fundamental idea = use data from past observations to predict unknown outcomes/values. 

E.g.:

- Ice cream store might use app that combines past sales and weather records to predict sales based on that days forecast
- Doctor use data from past patients to run tests that predict if patient is at risk from diabetes based on various measurements.
- Researcher use past obs to automate the ID of penguin species based on measurements of flippers/bill etc

Machine learning as a function
 - Because based on maths/stats, common to think of ML models in mathematical terms. 
 - Fundamentally, an ML model is an app that encapsulates a function to calculate an output value based on input value(s).
 - The process of defining the function = training.
 - After function is defined, you can use it to predict new values via inferencing.


Training data consists of:
 - past obs that include attributes/features of the thing being observed.
 - the known value of the thing you want to train a model to predict (the label).

Mathematical terms: 
 - features = variable name x, 
 - label = y. 

Obs will have multiple feature values, so x is actually a vector (an array with multiple values: [x1,x2,x3,...]).


consider prev examples:
 - ice cream sales;   goal = train a model that can predict ice cream sales based on weather.
                      Weather measurements (temp, rain etc) are features (x)
                      Number of ice creams sold each day is label (y).
 - medical scenario;  goal = predict if patient is diabetes risk 
                      Clinical measurements (weight, glucose level) are features (x)
                      Likelihood of diabetes (1 for risk, 0 for not) is label (y).
 - Research scenario; goal = predict the penguin species based on physical attributes. 
                      Penguin measurements (flipper length, bill width) are features (x), 
                      Species (0 for Adelie, 1 for Gentoo etc) is label (y).
