Regression
these models are trained to predict numeric label values
they are based on training data that includes both features and known labels
Process for training a regression model:
           - multiple iterations in which you use an appropriate algorithm (usually with some parameterized settings)
           - to train model,
           - evaluate model predictive performance
           - refine model by repeating training process with different algorithms/parameters
           - until achieve acceptable level of predictive accuracy.

4 key elements of SML training models:

   - Split training data (randomly) to create dataset to train model + holding back subset of data for model validation.
   - Use algorithm to fit training data to model. In regression model, use regression algorithm (e.g. linear regression).
Use the validation data you held back to test the model by predicting labels for the features.
Compare the known actual labels in the validation dataset to the labels that the model predicted. Then aggregate the differences between the predicted and actual label values to calculate a metric that indicates how accurately the model predicted for the validation data.
After each train, validate, and evaluate iteration, you can repeat the process with different algorithms and parameters until an acceptable evaluation metric is achieved.
