Regression
these models are trained to predict numeric label values
they are based on training data that includes both features and known labels
Process for training a regression model:
           - multiple iterations in which you use an appropriate algorithm (usually with some parameterized settings)
           - to train model,
           - evaluate model predictive performance
           - refine model by repeating training process with different algorithms/parameters
           - until achieve acceptable level of predictive accuracy.

4 key elements of SML training models:

         1 - Split training data (randomly) to create dataset to train model + holding back subset of data for model validation.
         2 - Use algorithm to fit training data to model. In regression model, use regression algorithm (e.g. linear regression).
         3 - Use held back validation data from step 1 to test model by predicting labels for features.
         4 - Compare known actual labels in validation dataset to the labels that the model predicted. 
             Then aggregate differences between predicted/actual label values 
             Then calculate metric that indicates model prediction accuracy for validation data.

    After each train/validate/evaluate iteration, repeat process with different algorithms/parameters 
    do until acceptable evaluation metric is achieved.
