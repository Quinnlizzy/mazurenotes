Regression
these models are trained to predict numeric label values
they are based on training data that includes both features and known labels
Process for training a regression model:
           - multiple iterations in which you use an appropriate algorithm (usually with some parameterized settings)
           - to train model,
           - evaluate model predictive performance
           - refine model by repeating training process with different algorithms/parameters
           - until you achieve an acceptable level of predictive accuracy.
