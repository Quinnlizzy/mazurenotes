Regression

these models are trained to predict numeric label values
they are based on training data that includes both features and known labels

Process for training a regression model:
           - multiple iterations in which you use an appropriate algorithm (usually with some parameterized settings)
           - to train model,
           - evaluate model predictive performance
           - refine model by repeating training process with different algorithms/parameters
           - until achieve acceptable level of predictive accuracy.

4 key elements of SML training models:

         1 - Split training data (randomly) to create dataset to train model + holding back subset of data for model validation.
         2 - Use algorithm to fit training data to model. In regression model, use regression algorithm (e.g. linear regression).
         3 - Use held back validation data from step 1 to test model by predicting labels for features.
         4 - Compare known actual labels in validation dataset to the labels that the model predicted. 
             Then aggregate differences between predicted/actual label values 
             Then calculate metric that indicates model prediction accuracy for validation data.

    After each train/validate/evaluate iteration, repeat process with different algorithms/parameters 
    do until acceptable evaluation metric is achieved.


Example:

Train a model to predict numeric label (y) based on single feature value (x). 
(Most real scenarios involve multiple feature values, more complex but the principle is the same)

Based on ice cream sales scenario;
         For our feature, consider temperature (max temp of a day), 
         For label, we want to train model to predict the number of ice creams sold that day. 
         
         We start with historic data that includes records of daily tempe (x) and ice cream sales (y):

         Temperature (x)	Ice cream sales (y)
                    51	     1
                    52	     0
                    67	     14
                    65       14
                    70	     23
                    69	     20
                    72	     23
                    75	     26
                    73	     22
                    81	     30
                    78	     26
                    83	     36

        Then we train the model.
        Start by splitting data & using subset of it to train a model. 
        Here's the training dataset:

         Temperature (x)	Ice cream sales (y)
                    51	     1
                    65	     14
                    69	     20
                    72	     23
                    75	     26
                    81	     30
    
        Then, to understand how relate to one another - plot cordinates along two axes. Point graph.

        Now can apply algorithm to training data & fit to a function that applies operation to (x) to calculate y. 
        
        One algorithm is linear regression; works by deriving a function that produces a straight line through the intersections 
        of x and y values while minimizing the average distance between line and plotted points
        (think line showing general trend on a graph)

        Line is a visual representation of the function where slope the line shows how calculate value of y for given value of x. 
        E.g. Line intercepts the x axis at 50, so when x = 50, y = 0. 
        Line slopes so that every increase of 5 along the x axis = increase of 5 up y axis (x=55, y=5; x=60, y=10)
       

                 So, to calculate value of y when given value of x, the function simply subtracts 50; f(x) = x-50


        Can now predict no. of ice creams sold on a day by its temp. 
        E.g. if weather will be 77 degrees; 77-50 = sell 27 ice creams.


Evaluating regression model

How accurate is model?
To validate model and evaluate prediction quality we need the held back dataset:

Temperature (x)	Ice cream sales (y)
            52	0
            67	14
            70	23
            73	22
            78	26
            83	36

Now, use our model to predict the label for each of the obs in this dataset.
So, based on (x) value; compare predicted label (Å·)(so x-50) to known actual label value (y)(what happened in reality).

Using model trained earlier, (function f(x) = x-50) results in the following predictions:
