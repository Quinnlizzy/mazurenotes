Binary classification

Classification, like regression is SML technique.
Therefore follows same iterative process; training, validating, evaluating models. 

        BUT Instead of calculating numeric values like regression;
            - algorithms used to train classification models calculate probability values for class assignment 
            - & evaluation metrics that assess model performance compare predicted classes to actual classes.

BinClass algorithms used to train model that predicts one of two possible labels for single class
            - Basically; true or false. 
            - Most scenarios; data obs used to train & validate model have multiple feature values(x) and a (y) value = 1 or 0.



Example - binClass
Simplified example using single feature (x) to predict whether label (y) is 1 or 0. 
Use blood glucose level of a patient to predict if has diabetes. Data:

            Blood glucose (x)	Diabetic? (y)
                            67	0
                            103	1
                            114	1
                            72	0
                            116	1
                            65	0


Training binClass model
Use an algorithm to fit training data to function that calculates probability of class label being true (diabetic)
Probability measured as value between 0.0 and 1.0
Total probability for all possible classes = 1.0. 

            E.g. if probability of diabetes = 0.7, then corresponding probability of 0.3 of no diabetes.

Many algorithms can be used for binClass.



Logistic regression algorithm;

Derives sigmoid (S-shaped graph) function with values between 0.0 and 1.0.
Function produced by algorithm describes probability of y being true (y=1) for given value of x. 
Mathematically, express function like this: f(x) = P(y=1 | x)

For 3.6 obs in training data, we know y is true.
Therefore, probability for those obs that y=1 is 1.0
For other three, we know y is false.
Therefore, probability that y=1 is 0.0. 
S-shaped curve describes probability distribution; 
Therefore, plotting a value of x on the line identifies corresponding probability that y is 1.

The diagram also includes a horizontal line to indicate the threshold at which a model based on this function will predict true (1) or false (0). The threshold lies at the mid-point for y (P(y) = 0.5). For any values at this point or above, the model will predict true (1); while for any values below this point it will predict false (0). For example, for a patient with a blood glucose level of 90, the function would result in a probability value of 0.9. Since 0.9 is higher than the threshold of 0.5, the model would predict true (1) - in other words, the patient is predicted to have diabetes.
