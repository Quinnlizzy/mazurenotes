Binary classification

Classification, like regression is SML technique.
Therefore follows same iterative process; training, validating, evaluating models. 

        BUT Instead of calculating numeric values like regression;
            - algorithms used to train classification models calculate probability values for class assignment 
            - & evaluation metrics that assess model performance compare predicted classes to actual classes.

BinClass algorithms used to train model that predicts one of two possible labels for single class
            - Basically; true or false. 
            - Most scenarios; data obs used to train & validate model have multiple feature values(x) and a (y) value = 1 or 0.



Example - binClass
Simplified example using single feature (x) to predict whether label (y) is 1 or 0. 
Use blood glucose level of a patient to predict if has diabetes. Data:

            Blood glucose (x)	Diabetic? (y)
                            67	0
                            103	1
                            114	1
                            72	0
                            116	1
                            65	0


Training binClass model
Use an algorithm to fit training data to function that calculates probability of class label being true (diabetic)
Probability measured as value between 0.0 and 1.0
Total probability for all possible classes = 1.0. 

            E.g. if probability of diabetes = 0.7, then corresponding probability of 0.3 of no diabetes.

Many algorithms can be used for binClass.



Logistic regression algorithm;

Derives sigmoid (S-shaped graph) function with values between 0.0 and 1.0.
Function produced by algorithm describes probability of y being true (y=1) for given value of x. 
Mathematically, express function like this: f(x) = P(y=1 | x)

            For 3.6 obs in training data, we know y is true.
            Therefore, probability for those obs that y=1 is 1.0
            For other three, we know y is false.
            Therefore, probability that y=1 is 0.0. 
            S-shaped curve describes probability distribution; 
            Therefore, plotting a value of x on the line identifies corresponding probability that y is 1.

Model diagram also includes horizontal line. 
This indicates threshold where model based on this func will predict true(1)/false(0).
Threshold lies at mid-point for y (P(y) = 0.5). 
Values at this point or above; model predicts true (1);
Values below will predict false (0). 

            E.g. patient with blood glucose 90; func result in probability value 0.9. 
            0.9 higher than threshold of 0.5 so model predicts true (1) (diabetes).
