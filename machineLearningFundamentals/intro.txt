Machine learning 
the intersection of two disciplines - data science and software engineering. 
The goal: use data to create a predictive model that can be incorporated into app/service. 
Requires collab between:
1. data scientists(explore and prepare the data) and use it to TRAIN a machine learning model
2. software developers who integrate the models into apps used to predict new data values (inferencing).
