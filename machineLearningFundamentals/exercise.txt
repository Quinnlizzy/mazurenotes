Create an Azure Machine Learning workspace

    need to provision an Azure Machine Learning workspace w/ Azure subscription. 
    Then use Azure Machine Learning studio to work with the resources in workspace.

        Select + Create a resource, 
        search for Machine Learning,
        create a new Azure Machine Learning resource 
        
        Settings:
                Subscription: Mine.
                Resource group: Create/select one.
                Name: Enter unique name for workspace.
                Region: closest.
                Storage account: default new storage account created for your workspace.
                Key vault: default new key vault created for your workspace.
                Application insights: default new application insights resource created for your workspace.
                Container registry: None (one created automatically first time you deploy model to container).
        
        Select Review + create, then select Create. 
        Wait for workspace to be created and go to the deployed resource

    Select Launch studio, Close any messages displayed.
    AML studio, should see newly created workspace OR, select All workspaces in left-hand menu & select one created


Use automated machine learning to train a model
    enables you to try multiple algorithms & parameters to train multiple models & identify the best one for your data.
    In exercise:
        use dataset of historical bicycle rental details 
        train model that predicts no. of rentals expected on given day based on seasonal and meteorological features.

    In Azure Machine Learning studio, view Automated ML page (under Authoring).
    Create new Automated ML job with following settings:
        Job name: mslearn-bike-automl
        New experiment name: mslearn-bike-rental
        Description: Automated machine learning for bike rental prediction
        Tags: none
        Task type & data:

        Select task type: Regression
        Select dataset: Create a new dataset with the following settings:
        Data type:
        Name: bike-rentals
        Description: Historic bike rental data
        Type: Tabular
        Data source: Select From web files Web URL:
        Web URL: https://aka.ms/bike-rentals
        Skip data validation: do not select
        Settings:
        File format: Delimited
        Delimiter: Comma
        Encoding: UTF-8
        Column headers: Only first file has headers
        Skip rows: None
        Dataset contains multi-line data: do not select
        Schema:
        Include all columns other than Path
        Review the automatically detected types
        Select Create. After the dataset is created, select the bike-rentals dataset to continue to submit the Automated ML job.

    Task settings:

        Task type: Regression
        Dataset: bike-rentals
        Target column: Rentals (integer)
        Additional configuration settings:
        Primary metric: Normalized root mean squared error
        Explain best model: Unselected
        Use all supported models: Unselected. You’ll restrict the job to try only a few specific algorithms.
        Allowed models: Select only RandomForest and LightGBM — normally you’d want to try as many as possible, but each model added increases the time it takes to run the job.
        Limits: Expand this section
        Max trials: 3
        Max concurrent trials: 3
        Max nodes: 3
        Metric score threshold: 0.085 (so that if a model achieves a normalized root mean squared error metric score of 0.085 or less, the job ends.)
        Timeout: 15
        Iteration timeout: 15
        Enable early termination: Selected
        Validation and test:
        Validation type: Train-validation split
        Percentage of validation data: 10
        Test dataset: None
        Compute:
        Select compute type: Serverless
        Virtual machine type: CPU
        Virtual machine tier: Dedicated
        Virtual machine size: Standard_DS3_V2*
        Number of instances: 1
    
    Submit training job; starts automatically & wait to finish

    Review the best model
        When the automated machine learning job has completed, you can review the best model it trained.
        On Overview tab of AML job, note best model summary. 
        Select text under Algorithm name for best model to view details.
        Select Metrics tab and select residuals & predicted_true charts if they not already selected.
        Review charts which show performance of model. 
        Residuals chart shows residuals (differences between predicted & actual values) as a histogram. 
        Predicted_true chart compares predicted values against true values.

    Deploy and test the model
        On Model tab for best model trained by AML job, select Deploy & use Web serv option to deploy model with following settings:
            Name: predict-rentals
            Description: Predict cycle rentals
            Compute type: Azure Container Instance
            Enable authentication: Selected
        Wait for deployment to start - may take few seconds. 
        Deploy status for the predict-rentals endpoint will be indicated in main part of page as Running.
        Wait for Deploy status to change to Succeeded.

Test the deployed service
    AML studio, left hand menu, select Endpoints & open predict-rentals real-time endpoint.
    On predict-rentals real-time endpoint page view Test tab.
    Click the Test button.
    Review test results, which include a predicted number of rentals based on the input features
    The test pane took input data and used the model you trained to return the predicted number of rentals.
    Review:
         used a dataset of historical bicycle rental data to train a model.
         model predicts the number of bicycle rentals expected on a given day based on seasonal and meteorological features.

Clean-up
        The web service you created is hosted in an Azure Container Instance. 
        If don’t intend to experiment with it further, should delete the endpoint to avoid accruing unnecessary Azure usage.
            AML studio, on Endpoints tab, select predict-rentals endpoint. 
            Then select Delete and confirm that you want to delete the endpoint.
            Deleting your compute ensures your subscription won’t be charged for compute resources. 
            You will be charged small amount for data storage as long as the AML workspace exists in your subscription.
            If finished exploring AML, you can delete the AML workspace & associated resources.

        To delete your workspace:

            In Azure portal, in Resource groups page, 
            open resource group you specified when creating Azure Machine Learning workspace.
            Click Delete resource group, type resource group name to confirm you want to delete it, and select Delete.
