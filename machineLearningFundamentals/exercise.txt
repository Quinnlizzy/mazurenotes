Create an Azure Machine Learning workspace
To use Azure Machine Learning, you need to provision an Azure Machine Learning workspace in your Azure subscription. Then youâ€™ll be able to use Azure Machine Learning studio to work with the resources in your workspace.

Tip: If you already have an Azure Machine Learning workspace, you can use that and skip to the next task.

Sign into the Azure portal at https://portal.azure.com using your Microsoft credentials.

Select + Create a resource, search for Machine Learning, and create a new Azure Machine Learning resource with the following settings:
Subscription: Your Azure subscription.
Resource group: Create or select a resource group.
Name: Enter a unique name for your workspace.
Region: Select the closest geographical region.
Storage account: Note the default new storage account that will be created for your workspace.
Key vault: Note the default new key vault that will be created for your workspace.
Application insights: Note the default new application insights resource that will be created for your workspace.
Container registry: None (one will be created automatically the first time you deploy a model to a container).
Select Review + create, then select Create. Wait for your workspace to be created (it can take a few minutes), and then go to the deployed resource.
