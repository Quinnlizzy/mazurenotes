In this module we’ve used several different terms relating to AI services. 

Here's a recap:

API – application programming interfaces (APIs)
enable software components to communicate, so one side can be updated without stopping other from working.

Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Multi-service resource

Single-service resource – a resource created in the Azure portal that provides access to a single Azure AI service, such as Speech, Vision, Language, etc. Each Azure AI service has a unique key and endpoint.
RESTful API – a scalable web application programming interface used to access Azure AI services.
