Create Azure AI service resources

Azure AI services are cloud-based - need to create a resource to use them.
There are two types of AI service resources: 
            multi-service 
            single-service. 
            
development requirements and how want costs to be billed determine types of resources need.

Multi-service resource: 
        a resource created in the Azure portal - provides access to multiple Azure AI services with single key & endpoint.
        Use resource Azure AI services when need several AI services/are exploring AI capabilities. 
        When use an Azure AI services resource, all AI services are billed together.

Single-service resources: 
        resource created in Azure portal that provides access to single Azure AI service, 
        such as Speech, Vision, Language, etc. 
        Each Azure AI service has unique key &endpoint. 
        These resources might be used when only require one AI service/want to see cost information separately.
