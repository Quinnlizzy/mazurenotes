Once create Azure AI service resource:
you can build apps using the REST API, software development kits (SDKs), visual studio interfaces.


Using service studio interfaces
        Studio interfaces provide friendly user interface to explore Azure AI services. 
        Inc Vision Studio, Language Studio, Speech Studio, and the Content Safety Studio. 
        Can test out Azure AI services using samples provided. 
        Studio-based approach allows explore/demo/evaluate Azure AI services regardless of experience with AI/coding.

Associate the AI service resource
        Before can use AI service resource, must associate it with the studio want to use on Settings page. 
        Select resource, then select Use Resource. 
        then ready to explore Azure AI service within studio.

E.g. Azure AI Content Safety service.
        To explore what Content Safety service does, use the Content Safety Studio. 
        First create either multi-service Azure AI services resource, or single-service Content Safety resource.
        Then, on Content Safety Studio Settings page, select resource & select Use Resource. 
        The AI service you created now assoc w/ the Content Safety Studio, & ready to be used.

When developers incorporate an AI service into apps, they often use a SDK or the REST API.
