Understand authentication for Azure AI services

ensure only those authorized have access to AI service through authentication, 
process of verifying that user or service is who they say they are & are authorized to use service.

Most Azure AI services accessed through RESTful APIs
API defines what info is passed between two software components: 
            the Azure AI service and whatever is using it. 
Having defined interface is important: if AI service is updated, app must continue to work correctly.

Part of API does is to handle auth
Whenever a req is made to use AI services, that req must be auth
Auth process uses an endpoint and resource key.

endpoint describes how to reach AI service resource instance that want to use,
(in a similar way to the way a URL identifies a web site). 

When you view the endpoint for resource, it will look something like:
https://myaiservices29.cognitiveservices.azure.com/

resource key the privacy of your resource. To ensure always secure, key can be changed periodically. 
Can view the endpoint and key in the Azure portal under Resource Management, Keys, Endpoint.

When write code to access AI service, keys & endpoint must be included in auth header. 
auth header sends an auth key to service to confirm that app can use resource.
