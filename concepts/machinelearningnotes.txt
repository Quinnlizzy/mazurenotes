How machine learning works


data. 
we generate massive amounts of information as data
Data scientists use data to train machine learning models
that can make predictions etc based on the relationships they find 
in the data presented.

in mazure:
azure machine learning studio = authoring experiences:

- automated machine learnin - non experts can create an effective machine learing model from data
- azure machine learning designer - graphical interface for no-code dev of ML solutiomns
- data metric visualisdation - analyze your experiemnts visually- Notebooks - write and run code in jupyter servers - intergrated in the studio
