Azure Ai: 
six principles, designed to ensure that AI applications provide amazing solutions 
to difficult problems without any unintended negative consequences.

1. Faireness
AI systems should treat all people fairly. 
e.g. create learning model to support a loan approval application for a bank. 
model should predict whether the loan should be approved or denied WITHOUT bias...
Azure Machine Learning includes the capability to interpret models and quantify the extent 
to which each feature of the data influences the model's prediction; helping identify and mitigate bias in the model.


2. Reliability and safety
AI systems should perform reliably and safely. 
e.g. an AI-based system for an autonomous vehicle; unreliability = substantial risk to life.
AI-based app development MUST be subjected to rigorous testing and deployment management processes before and after release.


3.Privacy and security
AI should be secure and respect privacy.
machine learning models rely on large volumes of data & may contain personal details to be kept private.
Even after the models are trained & in production, privacy and security must be considered.
As system uses new data & makes predictions/action, the data and decisions made may be subject to priv/sect concerns.


Inclusiveness
AI should empower & engage everyone
Should bring benefits to all parts of society regardless 


Transparency
systems should be understandable. 
Users be made fully aware of purpose of system, how works, any limitations.


Accountability
People be accountable for AI systems
Designers and devs of AI solutions should work in a framework of governance and organizational principles 
ensuring the solution meets clearly defined ethical & legal standards.
